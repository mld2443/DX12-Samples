# DX12 Samples
This is a project I am using to teach myself the Direct3D 12 API. I am starting with the fork of [RasterTek's D3D 12 tutorials](http://rastertek.com/tutdx12.html) and expanding upon them following his OOP pattern while injecting my own style into it. I will continue in the order of [RasterTek's own D3D 11 tutorials](http://rastertek.com/tutdx11.html).

I am also using insights gained from [BraynzarSoft's D3D 12 tutorials](https://www.braynzarsoft.net/viewtutorial/q16390-04-directx-12-braynzar-soft-tutorials) as well as Nikita Black's [Direct X 12 by Example tutorial](https://nikitablack.github.io/2016/07/23/Direct-X-12-by-example.html).
